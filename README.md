# Immature_GT_growth_survival
Here is some of the data and the code used for my dissertation chapter and publication on immature gopher tortoise growth and survivorship in differentially managed habitats. This serves as the data and code repository for the Ecology and Evolution submission. Please reach out to me if you are looking for something in particular and cannot find it (leynastemle@miami.edu). Data collection methods are detailed in the publication, which will hopefully have a preprint too. Summarized data tables that might also be useful are in the paper and in the papers supplement.
